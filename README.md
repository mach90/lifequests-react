L-Filter/Sort/Paginate
M-Implementing Filter/Sort/Paginate
M-Quest -> Contract -> XP update flow
JV-Guild quest -> Contract & Quest -> Contract relation per user (UI display and condition)
- If contract quest is finished it must be shown on the quest list and guild quests list, and a contract can't be signed for that quest anymore, the quest must also be hidden in the guild quest list
- If contract is active or finished, the quest list and guilds quest list must show that and disable the sign contract button
- Basically you can only sign a contract for a quest once, otherwise the button is hidden
